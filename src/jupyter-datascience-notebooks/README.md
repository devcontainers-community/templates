## Configurations

### Choosing a base image

You can choose from many base images to tailor the container to your project's needs.
If you don't know what this means, that's OK! Just choose the `datascience-notebook` option.
It has many packages for data science from the Julia, Python, and R communities. ðŸš€

ðŸ“š You can learn more about what each of these base images is and what features each of them
in [the Jupyter Docker Stacks reference page](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html).

### Default command

The default command of the base image is set to start the Jupyter server.
If you do not use the Jupyter server, comment out `"overrideCommand": false` of the devcontainer.json.

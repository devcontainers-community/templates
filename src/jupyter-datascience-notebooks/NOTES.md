## Choosing a base image

You can choose from many base images to tailor the container to your project's needs.
If you don't know what this means, that's OK! Just choose the `datascience-notebook` option.
It has many packages for data science from the Julia, Python, and R communities. ðŸš€

ðŸ“š You can learn more about what each of these base images is and what features each of them
in [Selecting an Image â€” Docker Stacks documentation](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/).

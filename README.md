💻 Ready to go with GitHub Codespaces \
🚀 Quickly get up-and-running with a devcontainer

**🤝 We want you!** If you're a community devcontainer template maintainer, we'd
love to add you to this project! ❤️ If you just want to hand off a devcontainer
template that you no longer want to maintain, **that's perfect too**. Open a
[Discussion] and let's have a friendly chat. 😊

## Usage

![Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Codespaces&color=181717&logo=GitHub&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![Devcontainers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Devcontainers&color=2496ED&logo=Docker&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

After creating a GitHub Codespace (or a devcontainer in VS Code), open the
Command Palette to find the <kbd>Dev Containers: Add Dev Container Configuration
Files...</kbd> command. After you run it, VS Code will guide you through the
creation of a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file!

Make sure you click the <kbd>Show All Definitions...</kbd> option to see our
unofficial templates!

## Development

🐣 The [@devcontainers-community] organization is still in its early stages.
This template repository is currently limited in scope. We are **only adding
popular templates from [microsoft/vscode-dev-containers]** for now. You can find
more information about our goals and plans in [devcontainers-community#1]. If
you notice a bug 🐛 or have an improvement suggestion 💡 we'd love to hear it!
😍

If you're interested in getting started modifying, adding, or testing a template
in this repository, you can do so without even leaving your browser thanks to
GitHub Codespaces! ☁️ After optionally forking the repository, you just hit the
green <kbd>Code</kbd> button at the top of the GitHub web UI and then
<kbd>Create codespace on main</kbd>. 🚀

After launching your dev environment and making some changes, you're probably
going to want to test those changes. To do so, you can run the `./test.sh`
script.

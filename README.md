🔧 80% of the configuration you'll ever need \
💻 Ready to go with GitHub Codespaces \
🚀 Quickly get up-and-running with a devcontainer \
🐳 No need to mess with a `Dockerfile`

## Usage

![Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Codespaces&color=181717&logo=GitHub&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![Devcontainers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Devcontainers&color=2496ED&logo=Docker&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

After creating a GitHub Codespace (or a devcontainer in VS Code), open the
Command Palette to find the <kbd>Dev Containers: Add Dev Container Configuration
Files...</kbd> command. After you run it, VS Code will guide you through the
creation of a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file!

Make sure you click the <kbd>Show All Definitions...</kbd> option to see our
unofficial templates!

## Development

🐣 The [@devcontainers-community] organization is still in its early stages.
This template repository is currently limited in scope. We are **only adding
popular templates from [microsoft/vscode-dev-containers]** for now. You can find
more information about [@devcontainers-community]'s goals and plans in
[devcontainers-community#1]. If you notice a bug 🐛 or have an improvement
suggestion 💡 we'd love to hear it! 😍

If you're interested in getting started modifying, adding, or testing a template
in this repository, you can do so without even leaving your browser thanks to
GitHub Codespaces! ☁️ After optionally forking the repository, you just hit the
green <kbd>Code</kbd> button at the top of the GitHub web UI and then
<kbd>Create codespace on main</kbd>. 🚀

After launching your dev environment and making some changes, you're probably
going to want to test those changes. To do so, you can run the `tools/test.sh`
script.

After creating a GitHub Codespace (or a devcontainer in VS Code), open the
Command Palette to find the <kbd>Dev Containers: Add Dev Container Configuration
Files...</kbd> command. After you run it, VS Code will guide you through the
creation of a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file!

Make sure you click the <kbd>Show All Definitions...</kbd> option to see our
unofficial templates!

## Development

This is just the **collection index** of all the templates that we have. The
actual source code for each feature is housed in each feature's own repository.
🏠 Why do this? I dunno. 🤷‍♂️

ℹ This magic index image is only really used by [containers.dev/templates] and
other indexing tools. You can use Dev Container Features without an index just
fine.

To add a new feature, you can [open an Issue]. It'll probably result in some
kind of new repository being created (or [transferred] to us if you've already
coded it up) and you being granted unrestricted access to manage it how you see
fit. 🤗

If you want to become a Member of this organization, just [open an Issue] and
we'll get you set up. 🎉 We're very open to new people.

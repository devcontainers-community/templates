## Conventions & linting

This repository is sort-of like a monorepo. We use a monorepo commit convention
where the PR title becomes the commit message of a single squashed commit when
merged with the `main` branch.

<div align="center">

This means that your PR should at least _try_ to conform to the conventional
commits format. Usually that means something like
"feat(jupyter-datascience-notebooks): make it work on M1 Macs". But don't worry,
it's OK if it doesn't. 🤷‍♂️ It just helps make the commits easier to reason about
when there's _so many subfolders_.

We also have set up [MegaLinter] for this project, so you should get a nice
linting report as a comment on your PR. Don't let it spook you! 🦇
